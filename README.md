# daily-learning

This repository contains my daily learning notes and small code snippets.

## How I use this repo
- Each day I add a short note file (e.g. `2025-11-24.md` or `day2.md`).
- Small code examples go in the same file or in a `code/` folder when needed.
- Commit message convention: `Added YYYY-MM-DD learning` or `Added Day N learning`.

## Quick links
- Day 1 — `day1.md`
- Day 2 — `day2.md`

> Tip: I update this README occasionally to show highlights and link to important days.
